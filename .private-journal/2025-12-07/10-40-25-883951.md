## Project Notes

ManVRelay Zendesk Integration Planning Session:

Rabble wants to connect the CF worker to Zendesk for content moderation workflow:
- Push reports/moderation activity TO Zendesk as tickets
- Pull action commands FROM Zendesk back to the worker
- Zendesk agents can ban users, delete events, mark safe from within Zendesk

Key decisions made:
1. Use ALL THREE Zendesk integration mechanisms (API push, webhooks, sidebar app + polling fallback)
2. All moderation activity creates tickets, but with configurable thresholds
3. Full moderation powers for Zendesk agents
4. Sidebar app lives in zendesk-app/ subdirectory for now, will extract to own repo later

Architecture:
- Worker gets new endpoints: /api/zendesk/create-ticket, /api/zendesk/webhook, /api/zendesk/context, /api/zendesk/pending-actions
- ZendeskClient class wraps Zendesk API v2
- Ticket builder formats Nostr context nicely
- Sidebar app is React + ZAF SDK, shows user context and action buttons

Created two docs:
1. docs/plans/2025-12-07-zendesk-integration-design.md - architecture overview
2. docs/plans/2025-12-07-zendesk-integration-plan.md - 17 bite-sized tasks

Worktree set up at .worktrees/zendesk-integration on branch feature/zendesk-integration

Note: Main repo has uncommitted TS errors from previous work (modified files in git status). The worktree is clean from the committed state.
