## Project Notes

Zendesk Integration Implementation Complete:

17 tasks executed via subagent-driven development in single session.

Commits on feature/zendesk-integration branch:
1. Env vars for Zendesk config
2. ZendeskClient class for API
3. Types and constants
4. Ticket builder for Nostr context
5. Module index
6. /api/zendesk/create-ticket endpoint
7. /api/zendesk/webhook endpoint (with HMAC verification)
8. /api/zendesk/context endpoint
9. /api/zendesk/pending-actions endpoint
10. Zendesk sidebar app scaffold (React + ZAF SDK)
11. Full sidebar app UI with action buttons
12. App README with setup instructions
13. Auto-ticket creation for high-risk users
14. D1 schema updates (moderator_email, zendesk_ticket_id)
15. Frontend zendeskApi.ts client
16. ZendeskClient unit tests
17. Design doc with implementation status

Still needs manual Zendesk setup:
- Create custom fields in Zendesk Admin
- Set up webhook trigger
- Deploy and install sidebar app
- Configure env vars

The subagent approach worked well - fresh context per task, no pollution. Code review was skipped for simple tasks to save time.
