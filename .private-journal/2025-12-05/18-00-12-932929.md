## Project Notes

Reviewing architectural design for merging Faro (T&S labeling) into ManVRelay.

Current ManVRelay setup:
- React app with NIP-86 relay management
- CF Worker handles server-side signing with NOSTR_NSEC secret
- Worker endpoints: /api/info, /api/publish, /api/moderate, /api/relay-rpc
- Uses NIP-98 for HTTP auth to relay
- NIP-86 for relay management (ban/allow events/pubkeys)

Faro system (from proposal):
- Kind 1984 (reports), Kind 1985 (labels)
- CDN enforcement worker
- Has its own /admin/block, /admin/takedown, /admin/unblock, /admin/list endpoints

Design proposes:
- Add 3 tabs to ManVRelay: Reports, Labels, CDN Rules
- Worker proxies Faro API with new endpoints
- Worker stores Faro AUTH_TOKEN as secret

Need to examine existing ManVRelay structure and identify gaps/issues in proposed design.
