## Project Notes

Resumed work on ManVRelay unified moderation service after Claude crash.

**Completed:**
1. Integrated Reports.tsx (kind 1984) into RelayManager tabs - now has 5 tabs: Events, Users, Reports, Labels, Settings
2. Created Labels.tsx component - views kind 1985 events with:
   - Timeline view (chronological)
   - Grouped view (by target)
   - Namespace filtering
   - Ban user action
   - Color-coded labels by category
3. Created LabelPublisher.tsx with:
   - Full dialog form (LabelPublisher) for creating labels
   - Inline quick-label form (LabelPublisherInline) for use in Reports
   - DTSP category presets
   - Custom namespace/label support
   - "Also ban this pubkey" checkbox for integrated moderation workflow
4. Connected Reports "Create Label" button to open inline label publisher

**Architecture:**
- Worker at /api/publish signs and publishes kind 1985 labels
- Worker at /api/relay-rpc handles NIP-86 ban actions with NIP-98 auth
- Frontend components call worker endpoints directly
- Label + ban can be done in single action via checkbox

**Pre-existing issues:**
- Test configuration issue with @testing-library/react screen export
- Some duplicate test files shown as deleted in git status

Build passes successfully.
